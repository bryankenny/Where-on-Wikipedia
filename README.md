# Where on Wikipedia

As our final project for the [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca) web development bootcamp, we chose to recreate the classic Carmen Sandiego games - where they came with a desk encyclopedia or almanac, however, we've decided to make use of a slightly more modern source.

## Usage

### The Easy Way

### The Hard Way

- Install MongoDB. I won't even try to offer instructions on how to do that.
- Clone this repository
- Using `.env.example` as a guide, create a `.env` file in the project's root directory. Change appropriate variables to match
- `npm install`
- `npm run seed` to create the database and example game.
- `npm start`
- Direct your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), replacing the port (3000 here) with whatever you have the server running on.

## Dependencies

- Node.js
